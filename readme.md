## Overview

This project provides a Python framework for developing, training, and backtesting automated trading strategies based on machine learning. It aims to analyze historical market data, identify predictive patterns using technical indicators and ML models, and simulate trading performance.

The framework systematically handles:
1.  **Data Acquisition:** Fetching historical market data (e.g., OHLCV).
2.  **Data Processing:** Cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
3.  **Feature Engineering:** Calculating technical indicators and defining target labels (e.g., Triple Barrier Method).
4.  **Model Training:** Training ML models (e.g., RandomForest) with time-series cross-validation.
5.  **Prediction:** Generating trading signals ("Buy", "Sell", "Hold") based on model outputs.
6.  **Backtesting:** Simulating strategy execution on historical data to evaluate performance.
7.  **Strategy Validation:** Employing techniques like Walk-Forward Validation for robustness checks.

## Project Structure

The core logic is organized within the `market_ml_model` package:

```
market_ml_model/
├── data/          # Data loading, sources, transformations, caching
├── features/      # Feature engineering, labeling, technical indicators
├── models/        # Model training, prediction, evaluation, optimization
├── strategy/      # Strategy definition and execution (main.py)
├── trading/       # Backtesting, simulation, position management
├── utils/         # Utility functions (metrics, visualization)
└── __init__.py
```

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd MarketAnalysis # Or your repository directory name
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the package:**
    *   For standard usage:
        ```bash
        pip install .
        ```
    *   For development (allows editing the code directly):
        ```bash
        pip install -e .[dev,full]
        ```
        *(This installs the base requirements plus development and optional dependencies like XGBoost, Optuna, etc. See `setup.py` for details.)*

    *Note: Requires Python 3.8 or higher.*

## Usage

The primary entry point for running a trading strategy simulation or backtest is typically within the `strategy` module. (Further details depend on the implementation of `market_ml_model/strategy/main.py`).

**Example (Conceptual):**

```bash
# Navigate to the project root directory if not already there
# Ensure your virtual environment is activated

# Run the main strategy execution script (adjust path/parameters as needed)
python market_ml_model/strategy/main.py --config path/to/strategy_config.yaml
```

*(Please update this section with specific command-line arguments or usage examples based on how `market_ml_model/strategy/main.py` is designed.)*

## Project Components Breakdown

### 1. Data Handling (`market_ml_model/data/`)
*   **Concept:** Fetch, clean, and transform market data (e.g., OHLCV).
*   **Implementation:** Uses libraries like `yfinance` (`loaders.py`). Handles missing values and ensures data consistency (`transformations.py`).

### 2. Feature Engineering (`market_ml_model/features/`)
*   **Concept:** Generate predictive features from raw data. Computes technical indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, ATR, etc.) and defines target labels for supervised learning (e.g., Triple Barrier Method).
*   **Implementation:** Leverages libraries like `pandas-ta` (`features_engineering.py`, `technical/`).

### 3. Model Training & Prediction (`market_ml_model/models/`)
*   **Concept:** Train ML models to predict trade outcomes based on engineered features. Implements time-series aware cross-validation (e.g., `TimeSeriesSplit`) and hyperparameter optimization. Generates probability scores or discrete signals.
*   **Implementation:** Uses `scikit-learn` (e.g., `RandomForestClassifier` in `training.py`). Handles model saving, loading, and prediction (`prediction.py`). Includes modules for evaluation and potential optimization.

### 4. Trading Simulation (`market_ml_model/trading/`)
*   **Concept:** Simulate the execution of trading signals on historical data to evaluate strategy performance. Incorporates rules like stop-loss, take-profit, and position sizing.
*   **Implementation:** Contains backtesting logic (`backtest.py`) and position sizing (`position/`).

### 5. Strategy Execution (`market_ml_model/strategy/`)
*   **Concept:** Orchestrates the end-to-end process: data loading, feature generation, model training/prediction, and backtesting. Often implements validation techniques like Walk-Forward Validation.
*   **Implementation:** `main.py` serves as the central script for orchestrating the strategy.

## Testing

This project uses `pytest` for unit testing.

1.  **Install development dependencies:**
    Ensure you have installed the package in editable mode with the `dev` extras:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .[dev]
    ```

2.  **Run tests:**
    Navigate to the project root directory (where `setup.py` is located) and run:
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```

3.  **Run tests with coverage:**
    To generate a coverage report:
    ```bash
    pytest --cov=market_ml_model tests/
    ```
    *(This requires `pytest-cov`, which is included in the `dev` dependencies).*
