Architectural Improvement Plan for MarketAnalysis Repository
============================================================

This document outlines the proposed plan to architect and improve the ``MarketAnalysis`` repository, aiming for enhanced robustness, maintainability, testability, and usability.

Phases
------

Phase 1: Foundation & Standardization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Dependency Management:**

   * **Goal:** Ensure consistent and reproducible environments.
   * **Actions:**

     * Consolidate all necessary dependencies (core and optional) within ``setup.py`` using ``install_requires`` and ``extras_require``.
     * Remove the current ``requirements.txt`` or repurpose it strictly for *development* environment setup if needed.
     * Introduce a dependency locking mechanism (e.g., using ``pip-tools`` to generate ``requirements.txt`` and ``requirements-dev.txt`` from ``setup.py``, or adopting ``poetry`` or ``pdm``). This guarantees reproducible builds.

   * **Rationale:** Simplifies dependency management, avoids conflicts, and ensures anyone using the project has the exact same package versions.

2. **Configuration System:**

   * **Goal:** Standardize and clarify how strategies are configured.
   * **Actions:**

     * Establish a clear hierarchy for configuration: Defaults (in code) -> User Configuration File (e.g., YAML) -> Command-line arguments.
     * Refine the ``StrategyConfig`` and related classes (potentially using Pydantic for validation and type hints).
     * Add a dedicated ``configs/`` directory with well-documented example YAML configuration files demonstrating various strategy setups.
     * Ensure ``strategy/main.py`` correctly loads and merges configurations from these sources.

   * **Rationale:** Makes configuring complex strategies easier, more transparent, and less error-prone.

3. **Code Quality & Style Enforcement:**

   * **Goal:** Maintain high code quality and consistency.
   * **Actions:**

     * Configure and enforce ``black`` for code formatting and ``isort`` for import sorting across the entire codebase.
     * Configure ``pylint`` (and potentially add ``flake8`` or ``ruff`` for faster linting) with appropriate rules.
     * Integrate these checks into a pre-commit hook (using ``pre-commit``) to automatically format and lint code before commits.

   * **Rationale:** Improves readability, reduces bugs, and makes collaboration easier.

Phase 2: Core Logic & Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

4. **Modular Structure Review:**

   * **Goal:** Ensure logical separation of concerns and adherence to good design principles.
   * **Actions:**

     * Review the internal structure and responsibilities of each submodule (``data``, ``features``, ``models``, ``trading``, ``utils``).
     * Refactor where necessary to improve modularity, reduce coupling, and adhere to SOLID principles. For example, ensure data loading is independent of feature engineering, and model training is separate from prediction logic.

   * **Rationale:** Makes the codebase easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

5. **Testing Enhancement:**

   * **Goal:** Increase confidence in the framework's correctness and robustness.
   * **Actions:**

     * Review existing tests in the ``tests/`` directory.
     * Increase test coverage significantly, aiming for >80-90% for critical modules (``trading``, ``models``, ``features``). Use ``pytest --cov``.
     * Add integration tests simulating end-to-end strategy runs with mock data.
     * Ensure tests cover edge cases and failure scenarios.

   * **Rationale:** Catches regressions early, validates functionality, and provides executable documentation.

Phase 3: Automation & Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

6. **CI/CD Pipeline:**

   * **Goal:** Automate testing, linting, and potentially building/publishing.
   * **Actions:**

     * Set up GitHub Actions workflows (in ``.github/workflows/``) to:

       * Run linters (``pylint``, ``flake8``/``ruff``) on every push/PR.
       * Run ``black --check`` and ``isort --check``.
       * Run ``pytest`` with coverage reporting across multiple Python versions (e.g., 3.8, 3.9, 3.10).
       * (Optional) Build the package.
       * (Optional) Publish coverage reports (e.g., to Codecov).

   * **Rationale:** Provides rapid feedback on code changes and ensures project health.

7. **Documentation Improvement:**

   * **Goal:** Make the framework easy to understand and use.
   * **Actions:**

     * Enhance the ``README.md`` with a clearer architecture overview (potentially a diagram), more detailed usage examples (referencing the example configs), and contribution guidelines.
     * Ensure comprehensive docstrings (e.g., Google or NumPy style) for all public modules, classes, and functions.
     * Set up Sphinx to automatically generate API documentation from docstrings and host it (e.g., on Read the Docs or GitHub Pages).
     * Add tutorials or example notebooks demonstrating common use cases.

   * **Rationale:** Lowers the barrier to entry for new users and contributors.

Phase 4: Advanced Features & Refinements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

8. **Logging & Error Handling:**

   * **Goal:** Improve observability and debugging capabilities.
   * **Actions:**

     * Implement structured logging (using Python's ``logging`` module) throughout the application. Allow configuration of log levels and outputs (console/file).
     * Define custom exception classes for specific framework errors (e.g., ``DataNotFoundError``, ``ModelTrainingError``).
     * Implement robust error handling, providing informative messages.

   * **Rationale:** Makes diagnosing issues during development and execution much easier.

9. **Extensibility Review:**

   * **Goal:** Ensure the framework can be easily extended.
   * **Actions:**

     * Define clear interfaces or abstract base classes for components like data loaders, feature calculators, models, and strategy execution steps.
     * Document how to add new custom components.

   * **Rationale:** Allows users to adapt the framework to their specific needs without modifying the core code.

10. **Performance Profiling (Optional):**

    * **Goal:** Identify and address performance bottlenecks.
    * **Actions:**

      * Use profiling tools (e.g., ``cProfile``, ``line_profiler``) to analyze performance-critical sections (data processing, backtesting loops).
      * Optimize code where necessary (e.g., using vectorized operations with Pandas/NumPy, caching intermediate results).

    * **Rationale:** Ensures the framework can handle large datasets and complex strategies efficiently.
