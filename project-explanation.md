# Automated Trading Framework

## Overview
This project is a framework for developing and testing an automated trading strategy. It uses machine learning to analyze historical stock data and generate trading signalsâ€”"Buy," "Sell," or "Do Nothing." The goal is to identify patterns that predict short-term price movements.

## Project Components
### 1. Data Collection (data_loader.py)
- **Concept:** Stock trading data includes OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume).
- **Programming:** Uses `yfinance` to fetch historical stock data based on a ticker symbol, date range, and time interval.

### 2. Data Preprocessing (preprocessing.py)
- **Concept:** Cleans raw stock data to ensure consistency and handle missing values.
- **Programming:**
  - Converts column names to lowercase.
  - Fills missing values using forward fill.
  - Ensures numerical formatting for price and volume data.

### 3. Feature Engineering (feature_engineering.py)
- **Concept:** Computes technical indicators like:
  - **SMA/EMA:** Moving averages to smooth price fluctuations.
  - **RSI:** Measures stock momentum.
  - **ATR:** Estimates price volatility.
- **Programming:** Uses `pandas-ta` to add these indicators to the dataset.
- **Target Labeling (Triple Barrier Method):**
  - Assigns labels (1: Profit, -1: Loss, 0: Timeout) based on predefined thresholds.

### 4. Model Training (model_training.py)
- **Concept:** Trains a machine learning model to predict trade outcomes based on historical data.
- **Programming:**
  - Uses `RandomForestClassifier` from `scikit-learn`.
  - Implements `TimeSeriesSplit` for proper time-sensitive validation.
  - Optimizes hyperparameters using `GridSearchCV`.

### 5. Prediction (prediction.py)
- **Concept:** Applies the trained model to new data to generate trade signals.
- **Programming:**
  - Uses `predict_proba` to output probability scores for trade outcomes.

### 6. Backtesting (backtesting.py)
- **Concept:** Simulates trades based on historical data to evaluate strategy performance.
- **Programming:**
  - Iterates through data to simulate buying/selling decisions.
  - Applies stop-loss and take-profit rules.
  - Calculates performance metrics including profitability, trade count, and win rate.

### 7. Strategy Execution (main_strategy.py)
- **Concept:** Walk-Forward Validation to adapt to market changes over time.
- **Programming:**
  - Splits data into training and testing segments.
  - Iteratively trains and evaluates the model on different time periods.
  - Aggregates results to assess long-term strategy effectiveness.

## Summary
This framework systematically:
1. Downloads and cleans stock data.
2. Extracts meaningful features from price movements.
3. Defines a structured trading decision problem.
4. Trains a machine learning model to identify profitable patterns.
5. Rigorously tests the model using walk-forward validation.
6. Simulates real-world performance via backtesting.

By following this approach, traders can evaluate and refine automated strategies before deploying them in live markets.
